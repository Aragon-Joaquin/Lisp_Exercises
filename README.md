# SICP - Exercises (USING Scheme LISP DIALECT)

An introduction to programming by reading through this book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://share.google/ggUrx4yjj69blEZOa) (copy provided publicly and free by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).

I'll be doing the Lisp exercises provided in the same book as i read through the chapters.

### note:
no, i wont be using Lisp anymore than for this case for these reasons:

- i preffer learning golang deeply to then use C more later on
- and i wanted to test myself if i knew i understanded the material explained in the book



thanks for reading. maybe i'll update my blog to include a very brief explanation of some chapters.
